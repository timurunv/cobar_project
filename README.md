# Miniproject for BIOENG-456: Controlling behavior in animals and robots

Welcome to the Miniproject for BIOENG-456!

## Setup
`pynput` is required for the KeyBoardController in `explore_levels.py`. To install it, run:
```bash
conda activate flygym
pip install pynput
```

## Usage
To explore the levels interactively, run the `explore_levels.py` script:
```bash
conda activate flygym
python explore_levels.py --level <level> --seed <seed>
```
Replace `<level>` with the desired level number (0 to 4 for the 5 levels, -1 for just a flat terrain) and `<seed>` with the random seed for reproducibility.

The `run_simulation.py` script contains code that will be used to evaluate the controller.

To run the simulation, use:
```bash
conda activate flygym
python run_simulation.py <submission_folder> --level <level> --seed <seed> --progress --max-steps 10000
```

Replace `<submission_folder>` with the path to your submission folder. An example submission folder is provided in the `submission` directory. It contains a controller that walks forward regardless of the observations it receives. You may use that as a starting point for your own controller.

A `test_controller.ipynb` notebook is provided to help you test your controller. You may for example use it to get the list of observations over time and plot them when designing your controller.

## Submission
The submission folder should contain the following files:
- controller.py: The controller code. It should contain a class named `Controller` that subclasses `BaseController` and implements the `get_action` method and `done_level` method.
- __init__.py: A file to mark the directory as a package.
- any other files you need for your controller.

You may run the `check_submission.py` script to check if your submission folder is valid and zip it for submission:
```bash
conda activate flygym
python check_submission.py <submission_folder>
```

## Creating a private copy while keeping track of the changes from the public repository
1. Clone this repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/NeLy-EPFL/cobar-miniproject-2025
cd cobar-miniproject-2025
```
2. Create a New Private Repository on GitHub:
- Go to GitHub and create a new private repository.
- Do not initialize it with a README, .gitignore, or any other files.
3. Set the New Private Repository as a Remote:
```sh
git remote rename origin upstream
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your_username>/cobar-miniproject-2025
```
4. Push the Cloned Repository to Your Private Repository:
```sh
git push -u origin main
```
5. We will notify you if there are important changes to the repository. To fetch updates from the public repository and merge them into your private repository, use the following commands:
```sh
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```
